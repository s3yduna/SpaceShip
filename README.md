# Unity301
Unfinished project as a result of Gelecegi Yazanlar-Unity301 course. The project I left unfinished while doing it with the course. It is currently a rocket that can be played with the WASD keys. It has meteors that spawn in a random direction as the screen is clicked. I didn't make any external additions.
